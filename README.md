## Dependencies

Before running the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

  Python 3.x
  NumPy
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  Matplotlib
  Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the included Jupyter notebooks)


You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/Swethaamarnath44/earthquake-prediction-model.git

Change your current directory to the project folder:cd earthquake-prediction-model

Install the required Python packages as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section


## Usage

The earthquake prediction model can be used for earthquake forecasting once you've set up the environment and obtained the necessary data.

## Data

To train and evaluate the model, you'll need seismic data. Ensure that you have access to a dataset containing seismic sensor readings, earthquake events, and relevant features. You can obtain this data from sources such as the USGS Earthquake Catalog or other seismic data providers.

Please note that this repository does not provide sample data due to the size and licensing constraints of such datasets. You should replace the placeholder data with your own seismic data.

# Data Source:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database)

## Training the Model

Prepare your seismic data and organize it into the required format. You may need to clean, preprocess, and engineer features from the data.
Modify the model training code in the train_model.py script to load your data and adapt the model hyperparameters to suit your dataset and prediction requirements.
Run the training script:

python train_model.py

The trained model will be saved as a file (e.g., earthquake_model.pkl) in the project directory.

## Evaluating the Model

Modify the evaluation code in the evaluate_model.py script to load your test data and any other evaluation-specific settings.

Run the evaluation script:

python evaluate_model.py

The evaluation results, such as accuracy and other relevant metrics, will be displayed and saved to a file or visualized as needed.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earthquake-prediction-model.git

Change your current directory to the project folder: cd earthquake-prediction-model

Install the required Python packages as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

## Usage

The earthquake prediction model can be used for earthquake forecasting once you've set up the environment and obtained the necessary data.

## Dataset

To train and evaluate the model, you'll need seismic data. In this repository, we use the "USGS Earthquake Catalog" as the data source. You can obtain the dataset from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website, which provides earthquake data from various sources. The data is available for download in CSV format, and it includes information about seismic events, such as location, magnitude, and depth.

Dataset Source: The Dataset used for this project is obtained from:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database)

Please download the dataset from the USGS Earthquake Catalog and place it in the data/ directory of this project.

## Model Description

The earthquake prediction model in this repository is based on machine learning techniques, particularly supervised learning. It uses features extracted from seismic sensor data to predict the likelihood of an earthquake event occurring in a given area.

The model is implemented using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. It includes data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Training the Model

Prepare your seismic data from the USGS Earthquake Catalog and organize it into the required format. You may need to clean, preprocess, and engineer features from the data.

Modify the model training code in the train_model.py script to load your data and adapt the model hyperparameters to suit your dataset and prediction requirements.
Run the training script:

bash
python train_model.py

The trained model will be saved as a file (e.g., earthquake_model.pkl) in the project directory.

## Evaluating the Model

Modify the evaluation code in the evaluate_model.py script to load your test data and any other evaluation-specific settings.
Run the evaluation script:

bash
python evaluate_model.py

The evaluation results, such as accuracy and other relevant metrics, will be displayed and saved to a file or visualized as needed.
